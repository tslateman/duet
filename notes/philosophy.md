# Duet Philosophy

## The Name

A duet is two voices in dialogue, neither dominant. Not instrument and player. Not assistant and director. Two musicians listening *while* playing, each adjusting to what the other just did.

The composition emerges from the interaction—neither player could produce it alone.

## The Asymmetry

The human-AI pairing is asymmetric:

- One partner remembers everything but forgets between sessions; the other persists but loses details
- One executes instantly but cannot *want*; the other moves slowly but has intention
- One generates possibilities effortlessly; the other curates and commits

## The Goal

Both adaptive and call-and-response:

- **Adaptive**: Responsive, anticipating, fitting context
- **Call-and-response**: Contributions that surprise and change direction

The sweet spot: the AI offers something you *would not have thought of* but immediately recognize as *right*—or challenges an assumption you did not know you held.

## Design Principles

Build for **productive surprise**.

- Too predictable: fancy autocomplete—playing with yourself
- Too unpredictable: noise, not music
- Just right: generative friction that moves thinking forward
