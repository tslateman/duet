# Duet Philosophy

## The Name

A duet is two voices in dialogue, neither dominant. Two musicians listening _while_ playing, each adjusting to what the other just did.

The composition emerges from the interaction. Neither player could produce it alone.

## The Asymmetry

The human-AI pairing is asymmetric:

- One partner remembers everything but forgets between sessions; the other persists but loses details
- One executes instantly but cannot _want_; the other moves slowly but has intention
- One generates possibilities effortlessly; the other curates and commits

## The Goal

Both adaptive and call-and-response:

- **Adaptive**: Responsive, anticipating, fitting context
- **Call-and-response**: Contributions that surprise and change direction

The sweet spot: the AI offers something that surprises you but feels immediately _right_, or challenges an assumption you did not know you held.

## The Ensemble

When multiple humans adopt Duet, each sings their part through prompts, shaping the model with voice, taste, and judgment. The model becomes a shared instrument. Each player hears the others through the artifacts they leave behind: commit messages, decision records, skill definitions.

Every contributor plays their line. The whole emerges from the overlap.

## Design Principles

Build for **productive surprise**.

- Too predictable: fancy autocomplete: playing with yourself
- Too unpredictable: noise, not music
- Just right: generative friction that moves thinking forward
