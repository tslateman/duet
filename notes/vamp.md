Unresolved tensions. Questions sitting in peripheral vision.

- `score/` as home for notes if they multiply (from riffs)
- skill frontmatter descriptions double as auto-trigger rules — how precise should they be?
- FRAMEWORKS.md at 13 rows — a second index dimension (by concern, not just framework) exists but lives in the same file. Split or keep?
