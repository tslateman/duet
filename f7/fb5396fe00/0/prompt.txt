Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Duet Tooling & Polish

## Context

The `/whats-next` analysis surfaced three tooling improvements and three polish fixes. Several turned out to already be in place (GH Actions, URLs), narrowing the actual work.

## Changes

### 1. GitHub Actions — already done

`.github/workflows/lint.yml` already runs `markdownlint-cli` on PRs to `main`, plus frontmatter validation and broken-reference checks. No changes needed.

### 2. URLs — already consistent

`install.sh`, README install/clone/update lines all use `tslateman/duet`. Git remote matches. No changes needed.

### 3. Pre-commit hook: generate-readme.sh before prettier

**File:** `.git/hooks/pre-commit`

Current hook runs prettier on README.md if staged. Add `generate-readme.sh` before it so tables stay in sync.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Regenerate README tables from source
"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/scripts/generate-readme.sh" >/dev/null 2>&1

# Stage and format README if content changed
if ! git diff --quiet README.md 2>/dev/null || git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "^README.md$"; then
  prettier --write README.md
  git add README.md
fi
```

Note: `.git/hooks/` isn't versioned — this is a local experiment per user's "let's try."

### 4. Resolve vamp.md

Remove the single remaining item. Skill frontmatter analysis confirmed descriptions work well — specific trigger phrases, no false positives observed. The dual-duty concern is monitored and resolved.

Keep the header and preamble so the file stays as a living document for future tensions.

### 5. Remove dangling `score/` suggestion from riffs.md

Delete bullet 4: `` `score/` as home for philosophy.md, riffs.md if they multiply—the written form of the composition ``

`notes/` works fine at two files. Speculative reorg with no evidence of need.

### 6. Move `/install-statusline` to Getting Started

Remove the orphaned line between Recipes and Structure sections. Add it to Getting Started alongside the existing entry-point guidance.

## Verification

- Run `scripts/generate-readme.sh` and confirm README.md is unchanged (tables already in sync)
- Stage a test change and verify pre-commit hook runs generate → prettier → stage
- Run `markdownlint commands/**/*.md skills/**/SKILL.md` — clean
- Confirm `notes/vamp.md` retains header, empty list
- Confirm `notes/riffs.md` has three bullets, no `score/` mention
- Confirm README Getting Started mentions statusline; no orphaned line near Structure


If you need specific details from before exiting plan mode (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/tslater/.claude/projects/-Users-tslater-dev-cli-duet/78128dc2-8e61-4ed0-961f-e76980e6c2cc.jsonl

If this plan can be broken down into multiple independent tasks, consider using the TeamCreate tool to create a team and parallelize the work.

rationale:

  The case for vamp

  - Jazz-native: vamping is what musicians do between sections — repeat a figure while listening, deciding what to play next. That's exactly the
  moment this skill serves: you're between tasks, surveying the project, choosing where to go
  - Fits the "duet" namespace — deepens the music metaphor rather than just sitting beside it
  - Imperative verb, one syllable, distinctive among siblings
  - The retro / vamp pair: look back at what happened, then vamp into what's next

# Commit Rationale Annotation

## Context

- Current commit: 0db5f1f fix: Move statusline to Getting Started, resolve vamp, prune stale riff
- Changed files: README.md
notes/riffs.md
notes/vamp.md

## Your Task

Annotate a commit with rationale using `git notes`. This captures the _why_ behind
a commit without changing its SHA.

### Arguments

`${ARGUMENTS:-}` — Three usage patterns:

1. **No arguments** — Annotate HEAD interactively
2. **Commit hash** (e.g., `13fe234`) — Annotate specific commit
3. **Quick rationale** (quoted text) — Attach directly to HEAD

### Workflow

1. **Identify the target commit**
   - Use argument if provided and looks like a commit hash
   - Otherwise default to HEAD

2. **Show commit context**

   ```bash
   git show --stat <commit>
   ```

3. **Capture rationale**
   - If argument is quoted text, use it directly
   - Otherwise, ask the user for the rationale

4. **Create structured note**

   Format the note as:

   ```markdown
   ## Why

   [The rationale provided]

   ## Context

   - Date annotated: YYYY-MM-DD
   - Files changed: [list from commit]

   ## Alternatives

   [If user mentioned alternatives considered]

   ## Assumptions

   [If user mentioned assumptions made]
   ```

   Omit empty sections (Alternatives, Assumptions) if not provided.

5. **Store the note**

   ```bash
   git notes add -m "..." <commit>
   ```

   If a note already exists, ask whether to append (`git notes append`) or replace.

6. **Confirm and remind**
   - Show the stored note: `git notes show <commit>`
   - Remind: "Push notes with `git push origin refs/notes/commits` if sharing"

### Example Output

After running `/why "Chose polling over WebSockets for simplicity"`:

```text

-# Commit Rationale Annotation
-
-## Context
-
-- Current commit: !`git log --oneline -1`
-- Changed files: !`git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r HEAD`
-
-## Your Task
-
-Annotate a commit with rationale using `git notes`. This captures the _why_ behind
-a commit without changing its SHA.
-
-### Arguments
-
-`${ARGUMENTS:-}` — Three usage patterns:
-
-1. **No arguments** — Annotate HEAD interactively
-2. **Commit hash** (e.g., `13fe234`) — Annotate specific commit
-3. **Quick rationale** (quoted text) — Attach directly to HEAD
-
-### Workflow
-
-1. **Identify the target commit**
-   - Use argument if provided and looks like a commit hash
-   - Otherwise default to HEAD
-
-2. **Show commit context**
-
-   ```bash
-   git show --stat <commit>
-   ```
-
-3. **Capture rationale**
-   - If argument is quoted text, use it directly
-   - Otherwise, ask the user for the rationale
-
-4. **Create structured note**
-
-   Format the note as:
-
-   ```markdown
-   ## Why
-
-   [The rationale provided]
-
-   ## Context
-
-   - Date annotated: YYYY-MM-DD
-   - Files changed: [list from commit]
-
-   ## Alternatives
-
-   [If user mentioned alternatives considered]
-
-   ## Assumptions
-
-   [If user mentioned assumptions made]
-   ```
-
-   Omit empty sections (Alternatives, Assumptions) if not provided.
-
-5. **Store the note**
-
-   ```bash
-   git notes add -m "..." <commit>
-   ```
-
-   If a note already exists, ask whether to append (`git notes append`) or replace.
-
-6. **Confirm and remind**
-   - Show the stored note: `git notes show <commit>`
-   - Remind: "Push notes with `git push origin refs/notes/commits` if sharing"
-
-### Example Output
-
-After running `/why "Chose polling over WebSockets for simplicity"`:
-
-```text
-Annotated 13fe234 with rationale.
-
-## Why
-
-Chose polling over WebSockets for simplicity
-
-## Context
-
-- Date annotated: 2025-01-15
-- Files changed: src/api/sync.ts, src/config.ts
-
-View with: git log --notes -1 13fe234
-Push with: git push origin refs/notes/commits
-```

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit.

You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. Stage and create the commit using a single message. Do not use any other tools or do anything else. Do not send any other text or messages besides these tool calls.
