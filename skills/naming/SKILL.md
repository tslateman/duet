# Naming as Design

## Overview

Naming difficulty is a design smell. When you struggle to name something, the abstraction is wrong. Use naming as a lens to surface confused boundaries, mixed responsibilities, and domain misunderstanding.

## Benner's Four Principles

Every name balances four properties. When they conflict, make the tradeoff deliberate.

1. **Understandability** — Describe the context it represents. A reader should know what it does without reading the implementation
2. **Conciseness** — Use only the words necessary. Longer is not clearer if the extra words add no meaning
3. **Consistency** — Same word means the same thing everywhere. Different things get different names
4. **Distinguishability** — A name must be distinct from its neighbors. Similar names for different things cause bugs

See `references/principles.md` for detailed rules and naming smells.

## Two Modes

### Review Mode

Examine names in recently changed code:

1. Read the changed code
2. For each name, ask:
   - Does it pass all four principles?
   - Could a reader understand this without context?
   - Is the verb specific? ("process", "handle", "manage" almost never are)
   - Does it match the domain language?
3. Surface violations with specific alternatives

### Design Mode

When naming is hard, use the struggle as a diagnostic:

1. What does this thing _actually do_? List its responsibilities
2. If the list has more than one item, the naming problem is a design problem — split it
3. Who calls it? What do they expect?
4. If it disappeared, what would break? That's what it is
5. What would the domain expert call it?

## Naming Smells

Names that signal design confusion:

| Smell                                  | Example                        | What it reveals                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Generic verb                           | `handleData`, `processRequest` | Unclear responsibility                |
| Suffix `-Manager`, `-Helper`, `-Utils` | `UserManager`, `StringHelper`  | God object or junk drawer             |
| And/Or in name                         | `validateAndSave`              | Two responsibilities                  |
| Type in name                           | `userList`, `nameString`       | Redundant or wrong abstraction level  |
| Negated boolean                        | `isNotReady`, `disableFeature` | Double negatives in conditions        |
| Abbreviated beyond recognition         | `usrSvcRsp`                    | Conciseness without understandability |

## Bloch's API Design Maxims

For public interfaces — APIs, library boundaries, module exports:

- **Names should be self-documenting.** If you need a comment to explain what a function does, rename it
- **Same word, same meaning.** Don't use "remove" in one place and "delete" in another for the same operation
- **Principle of Least Astonishment.** A method named `check` should not modify state
- **If it's hard to name, the design is wrong.** Rename the design, not just the symbol

## Evans' Ubiquitous Language

Code names should match how domain experts talk:

- If the business says "order" and code says "purchase", one of them is wrong
- Naming mismatches between code and conversation reveal domain misunderstanding
- When renaming, update tests, docs, and conversations — not just code

## Naming Checklist

For any name under review:

```
[ ] Specific verb (not handle/process/manage/do)
[ ] No unnecessary words
[ ] Consistent with similar names nearby
[ ] Distinguishable from neighbors
[ ] Matches domain language
[ ] Readable without implementation context
[ ] No embedded type information
[ ] Boolean reads as a question (isReady, hasPermission, canEdit)
```

## Naming Review

### Must Rename

- `processData` → `validateInvoiceLineItems` — "process" hides
  the actual responsibility; this only validates
- `handleClick` → `submitPayment` — name the action, not
  the event

### Consider Renaming

- `userInfo` → `billingProfile` — more specific to its
  actual contents

### Design Concern

- `OrderManager` has 12 methods spanning validation,
  persistence, and notification. The naming struggle
  reflects three responsibilities that should be separate
  types.

## Before/After Examples

### Functions

| Before               | After                               | Why                                                            |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `processData(input)` | `validateInvoiceLineItems(invoice)` | "Process" hides responsibility; name the action and the domain |
| `handleClick()`      | `submitPayment()`                   | Name the business action, not the DOM event                    |
| `doStuff(items)`     | `deduplicateContacts(contacts)`     | Eliminate weasel verbs; name what it actually does             |
| `run()`              | `pollForStatusUpdates()`            | Ambiguous in any class with more than one operation            |

### Variables

| Before   | After                 | Why                                                 |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `data`   | `unpaidInvoices`      | Generic noun → specific domain concept              |
| `temp`   | `unsavedDraft`        | Reveals intent; "temp" says nothing about lifecycle |
| `flag`   | `requiresApproval`    | Reads as a question; boolean purpose is clear       |
| `result` | `validationErrors`    | Names the content, not the role in the function     |
| `list`   | `activeSubscriptions` | Type-in-name smell; name the contents instead       |

### Types and Modules

| Before          | After                             | Why                                                      |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `UserManager`   | `UserRepository` + `UserNotifier` | `-Manager` reveals multiple responsibilities; split them |
| `StringHelper`  | `SlugFormatter`                   | `-Helper` is a junk drawer; name the actual capability   |
| `DataService`   | `InventoryClient`                 | Two generic words; name the domain and the role          |
| `utils/misc.ts` | `pricing/discount-rules.ts`       | File path is a name too; make it navigable               |

### Booleans

| Before           | After                           | Why                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `isNotReady`     | `isReady` (invert usage)        | Avoid double negatives in conditionals           |
| `disableFeature` | `featureEnabled` (invert usage) | Positive form reads naturally in `if` statements |
| `check`          | `hasPermission`                 | "Check" doesn't say what the answer means        |

## Strunk's Rule 12

"Use definite, specific, concrete language." The prose skill teaches this for English. Apply it identically to code:

| Vague     | Specific           |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| `getData` | `fetchUserProfile` |
| `item`    | `cartLineItem`     |
| `result`  | `validationErrors` |
| `info`    | `shippingAddress`  |
| `temp`    | `unsavedDraft`     |
