# Information Architecture

## Overview

Information architecture is the structural design of shared information environments. When someone asks "where does this go?" or "I can't find anything" — that's an IA problem.

Grounded in Rosenfeld, Morville & Arango's _Information Architecture_ (4th ed.) and the Diataxis documentation framework. See `references/rosenfeld-morville.md` for the core systems.

## When to Use This Skill

- Organizing a new project's file structure
- Restructuring documentation that outgrew its layout
- Deciding where new content belongs
- Reviewing a README or docs site for findability
- Designing navigation (tables of contents, cross-references, indexes)
- Auditing content for gaps, duplication, and orphans

**If someone can't find what they need, or you can't decide where something belongs, use this skill.**

## The Four Systems

Every information space has four structural systems. Evaluate each when reviewing or designing.

### 1. Organization

How content is grouped and classified.

**Exact schemes** — unambiguous, mutually exclusive:

- Alphabetical (glossaries, API references)
- Chronological (changelogs, history tables)
- Geographic (regional docs, locale configs)

**Ambiguous schemes** — subjective, require judgment:

- By topic (most documentation)
- By task ("How do I...")
- By audience (developer vs. operator vs. user)
- By metaphor (domain-driven structures)

**Rule:** Choose one primary scheme per level. Mixing schemes at the same level confuses navigation.

#### Taxonomy Construction

When reviewing a project's organization, evaluate whether the taxonomy is sound:

1. **Can every item be placed in exactly one group?** — If not, categories
   overlap. Tighten the scheme.
2. **Are items at the same level comparable in scope?** — "utils" alongside
   "authentication" mixes granularity.
3. **Does depth exceed three levels?** — Over-splitting signals the taxonomy
   is too fine-grained. Flatten by merging related categories.
4. **Can a newcomer predict where to find something?** — If not, the grouping
   reflects how the author thinks, not how readers seek.
5. **Can a newcomer predict where to put something new?** — If not, the scheme
   has gaps or ambiguous boundaries.

**Card sort heuristic:** If three people disagree on where an item belongs, the
categories are ambiguous. Rename or restructure until placement is obvious.

### 2. Labeling

What things are called — the names users scan to orient themselves.

- Labels must describe content, not container ("Authentication" not "Section 3")
- Consistent granularity — don't mix concepts and tasks at the same level
- Match user vocabulary — use the words people search for
- Avoid jargon at top levels; introduce it inside

### 3. Navigation

How people move through the space.

- **Global navigation** — always visible, orients the reader (README, sidebar, table of contents)
- **Local navigation** — within a section (prev/next, related pages, "See Also")
- **Contextual navigation** — inline links from content to related content
- **Supplemental navigation** — indexes, site maps, search

**Depth rule:** Three clicks (or three levels) to any content. If deeper, the hierarchy needs flattening or the content needs relocating.

### 4. Search

How people find specific things without browsing.

- File naming that greps well (`signal-contract.md` not `doc-7.md`)
- Headings that match search terms
- Cross-references from synonyms to canonical locations
- Consistent metadata (frontmatter, tags) for programmatic discovery

## Diataxis for Documentation

When the content is documentation, apply the Diataxis framework to classify pages:

| Mode        | Orientation   | Purpose                  | Form           |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| Tutorial    | Learning      | Teach through doing      | Lesson         |
| How-to      | Task          | Solve a specific problem | Recipe         |
| Explanation | Understanding | Clarify concepts         | Discussion     |
| Reference   | Information   | Describe the machinery   | Austere, exact |

**Each page serves one mode.** Mixing tutorial prose into a reference page degrades both. When a page feels unfocused, it likely conflates two modes.

## Review Workflow

### 1. Map the Current State

Inventory the information space:

- List all content (files, sections, pages)
- Identify the primary organization scheme at each level
- Note orphans (content with no navigation path to it)
- Note duplicates (same information in multiple places)
- Note gaps (questions users would ask that have no answer)

### 2. Evaluate the Four Systems

For each system, ask:

| System       | Question                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Organization | Is the grouping scheme consistent at each level? |
| Labeling     | Can a reader predict content from the label?     |
| Navigation   | Can someone reach any content in three steps?    |
| Search       | Do file names and headings match search terms?   |

## IA Review

### Structure Issues

- [Issue] — [Why it hurts findability] → [Recommended fix]

### Navigation Gaps

- [Missing path] — [Who needs it] → [Where to add it]

### Labeling Problems

- `[current label]` → `[better label]` — [Why]

### Content Gaps

- [Missing topic] — [Who needs it, when]
```

## Common Patterns

### The Growing README

READMEs that accumulate everything eventually fail. When a README exceeds ~200 lines, extract:

- Setup instructions → `docs/setup.md` (how-to)
- Architecture overview → `docs/architecture.md` (explanation)
- API reference → `docs/api.md` (reference)
- Tutorial walkthrough → `docs/tutorial.md` (tutorial)

The README becomes a signpost: project description, quick start, and links to the rest.

### The Flat Docs Directory

A `docs/` with 20+ files at one level signals missing hierarchy. Group by topic or audience, not by creation date.

### The Deep Nest

More than three directory levels for documentation means the taxonomy is too fine-grained. Flatten by merging related pages or promoting important content.

### The Orphan Page

Content exists but nothing links to it. It might as well not exist. Every page needs at least one navigation path leading to it.

## Placement Decision Tree

When deciding where new content goes:

1. **Does similar content already exist?** → Extend it, don't duplicate
2. **What question does it answer?** → Place it where someone asking that question would look
3. **Who needs it?** → Place it in the audience's natural path
4. **What Diataxis mode is it?** → Group it with the same mode
5. **Can you name the parent directory in one word?** → If not, the taxonomy needs work
