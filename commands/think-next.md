Pick ${ARGUMENTS:-1} question(s) at random from this list and present them:

- What would a 'Navigation Dead Reckoning' system look like for career decisions?
- How do you architect for forgetting - designing systems that gracefully degrade memories they no longer need?
- What's the engineering equivalent of muscle memory, and how do you deliberately train it?
- What would a 'compiler for human intentions' look like?
- What's the half-life of a decision, and how do you build with decay in mind?
- What would 'emotional CI/CD' look like?
- How do you measure growth through adversity without incentivizing unnecessary suffering?
- What patterns in your codebase would embarrass you if they became visible?
- How do you design for the engineer you'll be in 5 years, not the one you are today?
- What's the 'tidal' pattern in your work - the thing that advances and retreats but never stops?
- What would 'earthquake-ready' architecture look like for sudden market shifts?
- How do you instrument for questions you don't yet know how to ask?
- What's the simplest complex thing you've built, and the most complex simple thing?
- How do you paint with constraints - making limitation a creative force?
- What would controlled burns look like in software - deliberate destruction for ecosystem health?
- If 'people arrive at beliefs based on what they find attractive' (Pascal), how do you make good architecture attractive?
- What technical truths do you think you possess directly, and which might be mere familiarity?
- How do you design systems that please as much as they convince?
- What beliefs about your codebase exist not from proof but from attraction?
- When you consider the infinite space of possible solutions, which silences alarm you?
