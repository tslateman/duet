what should I work on next

---

Analyze this project and suggest what to work on next.

1. Review the current structure (README.md, directories, files)
2. Identify gaps or opportunities in these categories:
   - **Content** — Missing topics, incomplete guides
   - **Tooling** — CI/CD, automation, developer experience
   - **Polish** — Cross-references, consistency, organization

3. Present 2-3 concrete suggestions per category, briefly explained

Keep suggestions actionable and relevant to the project's purpose.

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit.

You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. Stage and create the commit using a single message. Do not use any other tools or do anything else. Do not send any other text or messages besides these tool calls.

---

reset the commit! we should run the prettier formatter on the README before committing it. just the readme, not all md

---

can we add this as a git hook rule?

---

local hook is fine
